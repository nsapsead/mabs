Are you busy every day but not increasing your income?

If so, you're probably focusing on the wrong things!

It's a common scenario in all industries (not just ours).

School owners pour their heart and soul into their business, spending countless hours working - yet their income isn't improving.

Often it's not the amount of work that is being put in - but what is being worked on that is the issue.

Developing curriculum, making sure the school is clean, administrative work, or social media scrolling can all eat into our day.

But these are not revenue generating activities.

Revenue generating activities are those that directly contribute to increasing our income.

These activities not only attract new students but also retain existing ones, creating a steady stream of revenue.

When you make your daily "to do" list (yes, you should) for you and your team, make a not of how many of the tasks on in will generate income for your school.

The PRIMARY FOCUS at our school is the students and their martial arts development - but every one of my senior staff also has a portfolio that is responsible for directly generating income for the school. It is measurable and accountable.
