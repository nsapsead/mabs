6 Stages of a Customer Journey...

Broadly speaking, there are 6 stages of a customer journey.

✅ Awareness - the initial stage where a potential customer or student first learns about a product or service through advertising, social media or word of mouth.

✅ Consideration - the customer begins researching and comparing different options to determine if the product fits their needs.

✅ Purchase / Decision - the customer makes the decision to buy the product.

✅ Retention - the customer continues to use the service and builds a loyal relationship with the brand.

✅ Adoption - The customer fully integrates the service into their routine and experiences its full value.

✅ Advocacy - the customer becomes a brand advocate, actively recommending the product or service to others through positive reviews and referrals.

Understanding these steps can help us to identify our strengths as well as where we need to improve.

See you on the mats!
