Launching a New Program at your School...

I think it was Abraham Lincoln who said "Give me 6 hours to cut down a tree and I will spend the first 4 sharpening the axe..."

We would use the same approach doing house raids when I was in VicPol. For what would be less than 10 minutes work after "knock knock", we would spend a couple of days doing recces of the target address, setting up rehearsals, practicing drive ups, door breaches, order of entry etc.

The moral of the story being to prepare things thoroughly before launching into action!

It's the same with launching a new program or class. 

Too many times I see school owners half-bake a program launch, just to watch it stumble along and then fall over some time later (hey, I've BEEN that school owner!)

If you're going to launch a new program, set the groundwork...

✅ test the waters for demand - talk to you staff, parents, students. Just because you think it will be popular won't necessarily make it so

✅ run a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities & Threats)

✅ find an appropriate time slot (taking into account age range & balancing out your timetable)

✅ get your Team trained up so they can deliver fantastic classes

✅ organise any equipment you'll need

✅ start building excitement! Coming soon, new EXCITING class...

✅ set a launch date - normally 6 to 8 weeks out

✅ market it! (both internally and externally where appropriate)

✅ REGISTER people for the first class or event

Remember the 'P's - Prior Preparation Prevents Piss Poor Performance!

See you on the mats!
