The Rule of 3...

You don't need me to tell you that student interaction and building a great culture at your school are keystones of retention.

And when you're a smaller school it's as easy as 1, 2, 3.
You know every student, their parents, their footy team etc.

But what happens when your school grows and you don't get a chance to interact with every student? 

Maybe you don't take all the classes any more. How do you make your Leadership Team show the same care and attitude you do?

One of the key points to doing this is to systematise your processes.

One of the most important we have is the "Rule of 3".
EVERY student in EVERY class has to be interacted with AT LEAST 3 TIMES.

Each interaction has THREE KEY POINTS:

ðŸ‘Š Eye contact
ðŸ‘Š Use their name
ðŸ‘Š Appropriate body contact (fist bump, high 5, pat on the back or shoulder)

This is a great topic for Staff & Leadership training, and a really engaging and valuable role play session.

Systems don't mean a lack of sincerity. They mean that things are done consistently and on time.

See you on the mats!
