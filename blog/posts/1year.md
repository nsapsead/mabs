It's hard to fill a bucket that is full of holes...
(old wise Paul Veldman saying...)

Unfortunately a lot of School Owners still take the approach to business education that there is no problem that enough new members can't fix.

And to a certain point, that's true.

But, as always, the numbers don't lie. It costs between 5 and 25 times more to get a new client than to keep an existing one.

In my opinion RETENTION is the NUMBER ONE growth tool for a martial arts school!  And why wouldn't you want to give your students and families such a great experience on and off the mats that they want to stay??

Here's some homework for you (no, there won't be a test...)

Grab your stats for the last 12 months.

Take your quits from each month, and divide that number by the number of active students you had at the start of the month.

I.e. 300 students in Jan, 12 quit that month = 0.04. Multiply it by 100 and you'll have your quit percentage = 4%.

Obviously the lower the better.  5% quit per month is considered industry average.  At my schools we aim for 3% and consider that a good month.

If you can do something to retain just ONE extra student each month, it will make a huge difference to the growth and income of your school.

See you on the mats!
