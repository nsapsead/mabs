Consistency is the key...

A student approaches you, and says "Coach / Sensei / Sifu / Kru, I want to get good at this martial arts stuff. What do I need to do?"

"Come to class consistently".

"But I want to get REALLY good."

"Come to class more often, apply what you're taught and put your best effort in."

"But what if I want to be really, REALLY good?"

"As above, but do it more".

You see what I'm getting at?

If you want to get "business" results from your school (and I'm assuming you do, because you're reading this blog!), then you've got to apply the same thought process to learning how to business.

Consider it a different martial arts style that you're starting out in.

We don't tell beginners to train 6 or 7 days a week. We tell them to hit 2-3 consistently for a start. Then they can look at ramping it up.

If you're new to focusing on the businessy part of your school, commit 2 or 3 hours a day - consistently.

ðŸ‘Š Learn how to track and read your numbers

ðŸ‘Š Do an audit of your current situation - students, fees, expenses etc (you'll be amazed at how often you can have a false number of students, or students who somehow have slipped through the net and are behind or not paying fees)

ðŸ‘Š Now you know where you ARE, have a serious think about where you WANT TO BE? What you do/ learn next will help you to bridge the gap.

ðŸ‘Š Identify where your "knowledge gaps" are, and prioritise the most important ones to fill

ðŸ‘Š Watch some "how to" MABS Teaching Modules

ðŸ‘Š Learn how to do a FB ad (there is a tutorial in this group and a bazillion more on YouTube)

ðŸ‘Š Get educated on Google Business Profiles & Google Ads (as above)

ðŸ‘Š Read listen to a business (audio) book

Putting in just 2 hours a day, 5 days a week = 10 hours a week. And let's be honest, if this is your full time gig (or you'd like it to be), then you can find the time.

Do that for 45 weeks a year, and you've gained 450 HOURS OF BUSINESS KNOWLEDGE! That's a truck tonne of learning right there!

See you on the mats!
