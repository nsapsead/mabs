# How to Fill Your Beginner Classes in 30 Days

*The system that's helped 200+ martial arts schools consistently fill their beginner programs*

## The Problem Every School Owner Faces

You've got empty spots in your beginner classes, but your phone isn't ringing. You're running Facebook ads, but you're getting tire-kickers instead of serious students. Sound familiar?

The truth is, most martial arts schools are using outdated marketing tactics that attract the wrong people. Today, I'm sharing the exact system that's helped over 200 schools fill their beginner classes consistently.

## The 30-Day Fill Strategy

### Week 1: Foundation & Setup

**Day 1-2: Create Your Irresistible Offer**
- 2-week trial with uniform included
- Clear value proposition: "Discover if martial arts is right for you"
- Risk-free guarantee: "If you don't love it, we'll refund your trial fee"

**Day 3-4: Build Your Landing Page**
- Professional photos of your facility
- Student testimonials (video preferred)
- Clear pricing and next steps
- Mobile-optimized design

**Day 5-7: Set Up Tracking**
- Google Analytics for website traffic
- Facebook Pixel for ad optimization
- Call tracking for phone leads
- Trial conversion tracking

### Week 2: Launch Your Campaign

**Facebook Lead Ads Strategy**
- Target: Ages 25-45, interested in fitness, self-defense, or martial arts
- Ad copy: "Ready to try martial arts? Get 2 weeks FREE with uniform included"
- Lead magnet: "Free Beginner's Guide to Martial Arts"

**Google Local Services**
- Optimize your Google My Business profile
- Collect reviews from current students
- Use local keywords in your ads

### Week 3: Follow-Up & Conversion

**Phone Script Training**
- Answer within 3 rings
- Use the student's name
- Ask qualifying questions
- Book the trial immediately

**Email Follow-Up Sequence**
- Day 1: Welcome + what to expect
- Day 3: Success stories from similar students
- Day 5: Reminder about trial appointment
- Day 7: Last chance offer

### Week 4: Optimize & Scale

**Track Your Metrics**
- Cost per lead
- Trial show-up rate
- Trial to enrollment conversion
- Cost per new student

**Double Down on What Works**
- Increase budget on winning ads
- Create similar ads for different audiences
- Test new headlines and images

## The 3 Keys to Success

### 1. Speed of Response
- Answer the phone within 3 rings
- Respond to online inquiries within 1 hour
- Follow up on no-shows within 24 hours

### 2. Clear Value Communication
- Focus on benefits, not features
- Use social proof (testimonials, photos)
- Address common objections upfront

### 3. Systematic Follow-Up
- Never let a lead go cold
- Use multiple touchpoints (phone, email, text)
- Track every interaction

## Common Mistakes That Kill Conversions

**Mistake #1: Being Too Salesy**
- Solution: Focus on helping, not selling
- Ask questions about their goals
- Listen more than you talk

**Mistake #2: Not Following Up**
- Solution: Set up automated follow-up sequences
- Use a CRM to track interactions
- Follow up until they say no

**Mistake #3: Poor Trial Experience**
- Solution: Make the first class amazing
- Assign a "buddy" student
- Follow up within 24 hours
