It costs between 5 and 25 times more to get a new client than to keep an existing one.</p>\n<p>In my opinion RETENTION is the NUMBER ONE growth tool for a martial arts school!  And why wouldn&#39;t you want to give your students and families such a great experience on and off the mats that they want to stay??</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s some homework for you (no, there won&#39;t be a test...)</p>\n<p>Grab your stats for the last 12 months.</p>\n<p>Take your quits from each month, and divide that number by the number of active students you had at the start of the month.</p>\n<p>I.e. 300 students in Jan, 12 quit that month = 0.04. Multiply it by 100 and you&#39;ll have your quit percentage = 4%.</p>\n<p>Obviously the lower the better.  5% quit per month is considered industry average.  At my schools we aim for 3% and consider that a good month.</p>\n<p>If you can do something to retain just ONE extra student each month, it will make a huge difference to the growth and income of your school.</p>\n<p>See you on the mats!</p>\n<p>Paul Veldman<br>Martial Arts Business Coach</p>\n",

The admin. The marketer. The cleaner. The customer service rep. The IT support. The events coordinator. The social media manager. The late-night message replier.</p>\n<p>And suddenly, you’re running on empty — with little to show for it beyond the satisfaction of a few great classes.</p>\n<p>That’s when the question kicks in:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>If you stop, does the business stop too?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the answer is yes, you haven’t built a business. You’ve just built a high-pressure job… for yourself.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>So, What <em>Is</em> a Business?</h2>\n<p>At its core, a business is a system that generates value <em>without</em> relying entirely on the owner’s presence. It can scale. It can be delegated. It can be sold. It can take a hit and recover.</p>\n<p>A real business has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Defined roles and systems</strong> — not just knowledge that lives in your head</li>\n<li><strong>Recurring revenue</strong> that doesn’t require chasing people each week</li>\n<li><strong>Staff or assistants</strong> empowered to operate without constant hand-holding</li>\n<li><strong>Marketing and retention</strong> that doesn’t depend on panic posts every time numbers drop</li>\n<li><strong>Clear separation</strong> between your wage… and the school’s actual profit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That last point is a big one.<br>If you’re just “taking whatever’s left” each month as your pay, it’s nearly impossible to know if your school is healthy — or just treading water.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The Burnout Trap</h2>\n<p>Here’s how this usually plays out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You open a school and pour your heart into it.</li>\n<li>Things start growing — more students, more classes, more admin.</li>\n<li>You do <em>everything</em> because no one else can do it “right.”</li>\n<li>You get stuck working <em>in</em> the business, not <em>on</em> it.</li>\n<li>Years go by… and nothing changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The burnout builds slowly.<br>You love teaching, but you start to resent the grind.<br>You miss family time. You skip holidays. You’re too tired to think strategically.</p>\n<p>You’re busy. You’re needed.<br>But you&#39;re not free.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Ask Yourself These Questions</h2>\n<p>Let’s get practical.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Can your school operate for 7 days without you?</strong><br>If not — what would need to change for that to happen?</p>\n<p><strong>2. Do you pay yourself a <em>fixed wage</em> that reflects the value of your role?</strong><br>Would you pay someone else that amount to do what you do?</p>\n<p><strong>3. After your wage is accounted for, does the business still generate a profit?</strong><br>If not — it’s time to look at your pricing, your structure, and your time management.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>From Hobby to Asset</h2>\n<p>It’s easy to mistake a busy schedule for business success.<br>But real growth happens when you step back and ask:  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“What am I actually building here?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The answer should be: <strong>a system, a culture, and a community that thrives whether you’re on the mats or not.</strong></p>\n<p>Because one day, you might want to sell the school, hand it over, or step back to enjoy more time with your family.<br>When that day comes, the value of your school will come down to one thing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Does it run without you?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2>Let’s Keep the Conversation Going</h2>\n<p>This isn’t about perfection — it’s about progress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What’s one area of your school you’ve systemised that’s made a real difference?</li>\n<li>What’s something still stuck in your head that you know you need to document or delegate?</li>\n<li>What would <em>freedom</em> look like for you in 12 months’ time?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more check out the <a href=\"https://www.skool.com/mabs\">MABS Community here</a></p>\n<p>Because your school deserves more.<br><strong>And so do you.</strong></p>\n",

You&#39;re managing timetables, refining programs, running events, upgrading systems and juggling business operations — all while trying to grow your student base and stay inspired.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s a lot.</p>\n<p>But what if you could sit down, face to face with someone who has already done what you&#39;re trying to do, and get a roadmap tailored specifically to your school, your goals and your next big idea?</p>\n<p>That&#39;s where 1-on-1 coaching comes in.</p>\n<h2>Tailored Strategy. Immediate Impact.</h2>\n<p>Unlike group webinars or generic online courses, a private coaching session is all about <em>you</em>.</p>\n<p>In just a couple of hours, you could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Map out a new upgrade system that adds significant value to your business</li>\n<li>Design and launch a Leadership Program that builds future black belts and assistant coaches</li>\n<li>Restructure your timetable to maximise mat efficiency and student retention</li>\n<li>Plan an open day or tournament that becomes the talk of your community</li>\n<li>Transition your current curriculum to a more scalable, rotating model</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This isn&#39;t theory. It&#39;s focused implementation with real-world feedback.</p>\n<h2>Coaching That Creates Momentum</h2>\n<p>We&#39;ve seen school owners walk away from one session with clarity, confidence and a clear path forward — sometimes unlocking ideas that transform their entire student experience and revenue model.</p>\n<p>A conversation with someone who&#39;s already walked the path can cut through the noise and help you take decisive action.</p>\n<p>Whether you need to refine an idea or launch something new, a single strategy session can create the spark you&#39;ve been looking for.</p>\n<h2>Is Your Idea the Next Big Thing?</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, all you need is a sounding board to help validate your idea, give you the steps to bring it to life, and avoid common missteps along the way.</p>\n<p>Whether it&#39;s a retention initiative, a kids&#39; curriculum, a special event, or something still forming — if you&#39;re sitting on an idea and unsure how to move forward, this session could be the launchpad.</p>\n<h2>Ready to Move Forward?</h2>\n<p>If you&#39;re ready to take action and make your next idea a reality, let&#39;s talk.</p>\n<p>👉 <a href=\"https://calendly.com/paulveldman/mabs-coaching-call\"><strong>Book Your Coaching Session Here</strong></a></p>\n<p>Not sure if it&#39;s the right fit?
